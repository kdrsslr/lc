This document is the project report of the LDIG project group, a project in the \href{http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/courses/summer-semester-20142015/citizen-science/}{\textit{Citizen Science}} course of the \href{http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/}{department of Digital Humanities} at the University Leipzig in the summer semester of 2017.

\todo[inline]{Catchy Aufmacher \& why Citizen Science is important.}

\todo[inline]{Catchy Aufmacher \& why Liquid Democracy is important.}

However, despite a few organizations (ref) using them for participative processes, no platform allowing for processes that truely allow for Liquid Democracy exists (as we will show in \ref{sec:Evaluation}, the tools we found are basically glorified voting tools). 

Furthermore, existing tools do not explicitly and readily make relevant scientific data transparent, and don't provide even the slightest assistance to citizens interested in understanding the processes taking place through them. 

We believe that it is about time for a platform that truely allows for providing the structure for liquid democratic processes that are comprehensible for the centrepiece of a democratic system, the mature, participative Citizen.


\section{Objective}
\label{sec:Objective}

As noted in the \href{ssec:Motivation}{motivation}, we believe in the importance of Citizen Science enabling liquid democracy within a participative system. Due to blablabla (reasons in a world characterized through the digitalization of the public sphere), we believe this needs to take place through a ... platform. 

As will be shown in \ref{sec:Evaluation}, such a platform does not exist. Thus our goal is to develop a platform, thoroughly grounded in the theory of both \href{sec:Theory_CS}{Citizen Science} and \href{sec:Theory_LD}{Liquid Democracy}.

The platform needs to enable the citizen to both participate in democratic processes in a way that respects its nature as mature political subject, as well as in enabling them to approach it as an object of research from a scientific perspective, even without being an expert in either the subject matter or research methods. 

It thus needs to provide the functionalities to exhibit the processes of a fully-functional, comprehensive liquid democracy process, as well as the ease of access and learning ressources, as well as research infrastructure to perform Citizen Science that deserves its name.

However, due to the scope, as well as legal and ethical requirements a fully-fledged Liquid Democracy platform would have to fulfill, we chose to take a more exploratory approach. 

Instead of creating a comprehensive real-world tool, we strive to develop a more playful approach, where certain aspects, mechanism and processes can be explored in a safe environment. For this we chose to make this a game, blablabla about the importance of homo ludens and learning through games.

Thus the objective of this project is to create a game exemplifying aspects and processes in Liquid Democracy with the a strong sensibility for questions relevant in Citizen Science. We want to open the possibility for a large range of researchers to observe the processes in these dynamic policy formation mechanisms, without compromising the privacy and security of the participants.

\section{Structure}
\label{sec:structure}


After \href{ssec:Motivation}{motivating} the context of this research and \href{ssec:Objective}{formulating the research question}, the \href{sec:Theory}{next section} will give discuss more thoroughly the two major societal contexts this project is situated in, namely \href{ssec:Theory_CS}{Citizen Science} and \href{ssec:Theory_LD}{Liquid Democracy}. From the discussion of these theoretic aspects, we will derive a \href{ssec:Criteria}{range of criteria} a platform for a Citizen Science-based Liquid Democracy game need to fulfill.

Subsequently, we will \href{sec:RelatedWork}{explore existing approaches} for Liquid Democracy platforms (or voting platforms as is often the case), presenting the current state of the art. We will \href{ssec:Evaluation}{evaluate} in how far these platforms conform to the \href{ssec:Criteria}{criteria derived from the theory}. 

As will be shown, no existing approach is suited to fulfill the criteria. Thus, in \href{sec:ProjectRequirements}{the following section} we will develop a platform based on the requirements sketched before. This will be done by \href{ssec:SoftwareRequirements}{compiling product requirements} the platform needs to fulfill in order to meet the projects requirements. \href{ssec:Implementation}{Subsequently}, we will describe the implementation of a prototype based on the software requirements set before.

Finally, we will \href{sec:Conclusion}{conclude} by critically discussing the \href{ssec:DiscussionImplementation}{prototype implementation} in the context of the project, with a particular focus on the \href{ssec:Criteria}{criteria derived from the theory}, before we will conclude with a discussion of \href{ssec:FutureWork}{future work}.
