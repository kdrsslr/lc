\chapter{Conclusion / Discussion}
\label{ch:Conclusion}


This section concludes the project report. In this section we will reflect at the process of this project / the result of this project. We will summarize the most crucial points of an integrated, Citizen Science based, 'playful' perspective on Liquid democracy, and defend our decision of implementing a prototype for this context from scratch.

Will further discuss the \nameref{sec:DiscussionImplementation}, and the state of the software. We will conclude with a \nameref{sec:FutureWork}, or processes that any true project aiming at what we aimed for would need to be able to implement in order to become anything that is not just a proof-of-concept state.
