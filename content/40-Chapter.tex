\chapter{Related Work / Background}
\label{ch:RelatedWork}


This section will discuss existing work related to the project at hand. Since the accessibility of democratic process is the focus of this project, this section will focus mainly on solutions that implement aspects relevant for this. 

As Citizen Science primarily regards the accessibility of data as well as educational resources, the focus of this section will be on Liquid Democracy, or better said which aspects are well-addressed in the literature and existing technical solutions. However, aspects of accessibility will be discussed due to their importance for project at hand.

The core of this section will be an \hyperref[sec:Evaluation]{evaluation} of existing approaches, based on the criteria derived in \ref{sec:Criteria}. These will be discussed in \autoref{sec:DiscussionRW}, and we will evaluate which platforms serve as a basis for the prototype this project strives to develop.

Basically say why its all rubbish and we need to do it ourselves, leading into the \hyperref[ch:ProjectRequirements]{requirements}.
