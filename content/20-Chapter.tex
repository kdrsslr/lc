\chapter{Theory}
\label{ch:Theory}

In this section we will discuss the theoretical background of the project on which this report is based on. As noted in the introduction, the project aims at designing a Citizen Science accessible Liquid Democracy game and developing its (technical) specification. As such, it needs to be grounded in a thorough understanding of both the concept of \hyperref[sec:Theory_CS]{Citizen Science} and \hyperref[sec:Liquid_Democracy]{Liquid Democracy}. Additionally it needs to identify and address the problems and issues raised in relation to these concepts. 

In order to address these issues, a discussion of their context is indispensable. In recognition of this, the structure of this section is as follows:
After introducing the basic terms and the context they stem from (in \ref{ssec:Background_CS} and \ref{ssec:Liquid_Democracy}
respectively), issues and open questions are addressed for both concepts separately (in \ref{sec:Issues_CS} and \ref{ssec:LD-Critical-Perspective} respectively). 

Following a discussion on the background of the respective concepts, we will \hyperref[sec:Integration_CSLD]{discuss synergies and challenges} of integrating these perspectives. Based on this integrative perspective and the aspects discussed in the beginning of this section, we will \hyperref[sec:Criteria]{derive a number of criteria} a Liquid Democracy game grounded in Citizen Science needs to exhibit, in order to develop a theory-grounded approach to the project's objective.

In this section, we discuss the theoretical background the project is based on. As noted in the introduction, the project aims to develop a Citizen Science accessible Liquid Democracy game. As such, first of all, it is necessary to understand both the concept of Citizen Science and Liquid Democracy. Both terms are vast and used in many different backgrounds. Therefore, in the following section we examine both terms separately, to then have a closer look on how the project itself combines Citizen Science and Liquid Democracy. In a first step, we look closer at the term Citizen Science, it´s background and three theoretical perspectives on how to describe and classify Citizen Science. Finally, we summarize the common points of these three theories as well as open questions and difficulties a project of this nature might face.

\section{Citizen Science}
\label{sec:Theory_CS}
\subsection{Background of Citizen Science}
\label{ssec:Background_CS}
Although Citizen Science in today’s academic world appears to be a rather contemporary term, the idea of Citizens being involved in the scientific process dates way back. Taking, for instance, the \textit{Christmas Bird Count}; in 1900 the ornithologist Frank Champman introduced the project--- involving citizens in a yearly bird count---on Christmas Day. Starting with 27 participants the number of volunteers over the years has been growing significantly. Until today scientists use the accumulated longitudinal data of around 53 000 active members for large scale analyses that have been crucial for findings around population, distribution of species and migration etc. \parencite{Lebaron2017}. With modern technologies, the possibilities to involve citizens in the scientific process have become more various which consequently has led to a rapidly growing amount of Citizen Science projects. 

However, with increasing popularity, the term itself has become widely and rather differently used which makes it difficult to accurately define and differentiate it. Although the basic definition of involving members of the public in scientific research projects has remained, this definition leaves several questions open: Which sort of participation and to which extent the citizens are involved in a project? What defines a citizen and what does it need to qualify a citizen science project? In the past several years researchers have tried to define more systematically what citizen science means and what a \tracknshrink{CS} project can consist of. In the following, we will look at two  different theoretical perspectives on Citizen Science projects. 



\subsection{Types of Citizen Science Projects}
\label{ssec:Types_CS}
As mentioned before, the number of Citizen Science projects has expanded. Experience has shown that with thoughtful study design and under the right circumstances, Citizen Science can work on a massive scale, generating high-quality data that lead to reliable, valid scientific outcomes as well as unexpected insights and innovations  \parencite{Hakalay2014}. Therefore, more and more scientist involve Citizen Science in their research process. Though looking at various CS projects it quickly becomes  obvious that although they all involve some sort of citizen participation the projects themselves are quite different. \citeauthor{WigginsCrowston2011} have therefore created a typology, categorizing the projects into six different types. Examining common characteristics of 36 projects, grouping similar projects that share the same structure of participation, and some organizational as well as macro structural properties. The authors differentiate between action-, origination-, conversation-, investigation-, virtual- and educational projects. Looking at the different kinds of projects they also summarize scientific organizational as well as technology issues common with the different “modes” of Citizen Science \parencite{WigginsCrowston2011}. The following sections provide a brief overview on the different types of projects. 

\subsubsection{Action Based Projects}
Action-oriented projects generally encourage participants to intervene in local concerns, using scientific research methods as a tool to support civic agendas. In contrast to other types of initiatives, an action-orientated project materializes in form of a grassroots movement, as they are generally neither conceived nor planned by scientists. As an example, the \textit{Sherman’s Creek Conservation Association}, an organization with the goal to protect local creek and to provide environmental education. In action-based projects, so \citeauthor{WigginsCrowston2011}, researchers are often more consultants than collaborators. The, therefore, missing scientific method and spatial training generally prevent the collected data to become part of the scholarly knowledge base. The fact that these often are originated on a local level and is as well originated regarding local concerns cause the problem that there often lack funding and infrastructure which make it difficult for the project grow bigger than the original local level \parencite{WigginsCrowston2011}.

\subsubsection{Conservation Projects}
Conservation projects support stewardship and natural resource management goals, primarily in the area of ecology. Like Action projects, they are strongly rooted in local communes and volunteer engagement focuses on data collection activities, but in contrast to the Action projects, most conservation projects have affiliations with larger agencies.  Most projects include explicit educational goals or content. In regard to the scientific level, conservation projects often show a larger involvement of scientist, and projects without strong academic affiliations are typically lead by professional researchers employed in governmental organizations. From an organizational point of view, it is interesting to observe that conservational-oriented projects can be organized with top-down (researcher-initiated) as well as middle-out structures  (management-initiation)  \parencite[xx]{WigginsCrowston2011}.

\subsubsection{Investigation Projects}
Investigation projects are---in contrast to the conservational and action-based projects---focused on the scientific research goals which often consist of data collection. From this point of view, the Investigation project fits the other definitions of Citizen Science projects (\cite{Hakalay2014} \& \cite{Arnstein1969}). While education is not the foremost goal, some background material is often provided informing about the scientific background. Examples such as Great Sunflower\footnote{\url{https://www.greatsunflower.org/}} and FoldIt\footnote{\url{https://fold.it/portal/}} prove that this type of projects have the capability to engage thousands of participants, and to scale accordingly. Most Investigation projects involve or nonprofit conservation organizations as the primary organizers, and a top-down structure of organizing is a defining characteristic. Organizational issues appear with a fast growing number of participants as management and sustainability challenges grow accordingly. \parencite{WigginsCrowston2011}

\subsubsection{Education Projects}
As the name indicates the primary goal of Education projects is education and outreach. An exemplary project here is Fossil Finders\footnote{\url{http://fossilfinder.org/}}. The project is connecting educators, students as well as researchers to develop workshops primarily for schools. Because of the ‘classroom atmosphere’ and supervised inquiry-based format, this particular project permits on the one hand a close involvement of the participants into the scientific process and on the other hand it also facilitates the expansion and extension of the project activities, such as collection, identification, and description of additional fossils. Nevertheless, the emphasis on education projects lies in the educational aspect while scientific contribution is of secondary importance. Additionally, the relative cost of acquiring data through education projects is substantially higher. All the above often end in education projects only being considered as a Citizen Science project only by the presence of including an academic institution or researcher as an organizer. Proceeding to the organizational issues, it is hardly surprising that all of the mentioned sample projects are top-down organized. Involving multiple partners the examined project all have substantial funding \parencite[xx]{WigginsCrowston2011}.

\subsubsection{Virtual Projects}
In contrast to all other project types described above, virtual projects are completely ICT-mediated with no physical element whatsoever. The exclusively virtual -based project shares its goal with investigation projects as its main focus is the scientific research often in form of data collection. While examples of these projects are numerous, for example: Galaxy Zoo\footnote{\url{https://www.zooniverse.org/}}, Whale FM\footnote{\url{https://whale.fm/}} and Planet hunter\footnote{\url{https://blog.planethunters.org/}}, the line to projects that not further fall under the definition to Citizen Science is narrow. Whether Citizen Science is defined as citizen participation or includes an active involvement of its members, virtual projects often run danger to not match the definition of a citizen science project \parencite{Hakalay2014}. As for investigation projects, the primary challenge for virtual projects is ensuring valid scientific results. This matter is complicated by the fact that it is rather difficult to maintain the volunteers’ interests. Even though motivation concerns are often addressed by game-like task design, it is often difficult to collect valid data. Many virtual projects compensate the missing quality of the data by providing a quantity of tasks. Nevertheless, this problematic is worth keeping in mind. Looking at the organization of virtual projects, \citeauthor{WigginsCrowston2011} conclude that all of their examined projects are top-down organized and exclusively run by academics. Consequently, the projects are most and foremost financed by research funding and shareholders what often poses a threat to the project’s sustainability. \parencite{WigginsCrowston2011}

\subsection{Haklay’s Ladder of Participation}
\label{ssec:Ladder_Participation_CS}

The extent to which volunteers are involved in a Citizen Science project plays a crucial part regarding the nature of the project. To qualify as a Citizen Science project the non-professional scientists must take an active role in the research process \parencite{Eitzeletal2017}. This “active” role, however, ranges form discovering objects in pictures (like in Galaxy Zoo) to finding, describing and identifying actual Fossils\footnote{\url{http://fossilfinder.org/}}. To closer define this rather large spectrum of participation \citeauthor{Hakalay2014} introduces the \textit{Ladder of Participation} distinguishing between four different levels of involvement. At the most basic level, participation is limited to the provision of data/resources and minimal cognitive engagement. Hacklay titles this level of participation \textit{Crowd Sourcing} as volunteers often barely function as better sensors \parencite[xx]{Hakalay2014}.

The next level is the so-called \textit{Distributed Intelligence}. Here the cognitive ability of the participants is crucial. Many Citizen Science projects operate on this level. Volunteers are needed to take some basic training to collect data or carry out simple interpretation activity. On this level of engagement volunteers with time can learn more about the topic and advance beyond their initial training and be given more advanced tasks \parencite[xx]{Hakalay2014}.

What distinguishes the next level \textit{Participatory Science} is that the volunteers are involved not only in the data collection but in the problem definition. In the above mentioned Fossil Finders project the participants are not only engaged in data collection but also---with assistance of experts---taking part in the analysis and interpretation of the results. Participants can suggest research question, which than can be explored with the data collected \parencite[xx]{Hakalay2014}.

The last and highest level on the ladder is the level of \textit{Collaborative Science}. Here the participants can choose their level of engagement and can be potentially involved in analysis, publication or utilization of the results. Scientists, in addition to their role as experts, function as facilitators. \citeauthor{Hakalay2014} states, that this mode of Citizen Science even opens the possibility of Citizen Science without professional scientists \parencite[xx]{Hakalay2014}.

\citeauthor{Hakalay2014} summarizes, that one project not necessarily have to be classified in only one category. Seeing for example the volunteer computing projects. While most participants will start  at the bottom level, collecting data or carrying out basic interpretation, some volunteers  might move to the second level assisting or teaching other volunteers, or even  communicate with the scientists, discussing results or suggest new research directions \parencite[xx]{Hakalay2014}. \citeauthor{Hakalay2014} concludes that participation in Citizen Science can take different forms, while in some projects the gap between professional scientist and participants is wider, other projects facilitate collaboration, teaching volunteers so that they become more involved in the scientific process altogether.

\subsection{Issues and Open Questions}
\label{sec:Issues_CS}

\citeauthor{WigginsCrowston2011} and \citeauthor{Hakalay2014} agree, that the number, as well as the diversity of Citizen Science projects, are vast. Nevertheless, the objective to include citizens in the scientific process itself sometimes seems to be at the very core of the project and other times more of a side effect. It also appears that even though the number of Citizen Science projects is growing, the data is still used cautiously in papers and scientific publications \parencite[xx]{Hakalay2014}. Especially for projects in which the influence of scientist is relatively small. \citeauthor[xx]{FlanaginMetzger2008} state that this might be due to the fact that many researchers still mistrust the quality of the data produced by citizens. While \citeauthor[xx]{Holling1998} emphasized that there are two cultures of science and that Citizen Science by necessity belongs to the type of science that incorporates uncertainty and highlights integrative approaches \parencite[xx]{Holling1998}

Another question left open is what exactly defines a Citizen and what a Scientist. Through the preceding text, we deliberately have left this question open since Citizen Science itself questions---to some extent---the classic definition of Science as well. Defining a scientist as someone being employed to carry out scientific work or research the differentiation stays rather clear. But as soon as it comes to unpaid scientists the situation is far more complex. It would mean to define scientists throughout their way of working with scientific frameworks, data collection, and interpretation as well as their overview and knowledge about the field, being able to place the newly retrieved information in the already existing body of work. Nevertheless, pursuing this definition a well-trained and informed citizen could then also meet these criteria. Authors like \citeauthor{StilgoeLockWilsdon_2014} and \citeauthor{Irwin1995} take this thought process one step further declaring that changing the epistemology of science could be seen as one goal of Citizen Science. They advocate that on a “extreme” level of Citizen Science the emphasis shouldn´t be on the citizen as a scientist but the scientist as a citizen. Meaning that in some cases it shouldn’t be possible to draw the line between Scientist and Citizen. However, \citeauthor{Irwin1995} also notes that this way of conceptualizing and practicing science is not widely accepted in the current culture of science. \parencite[xx]{Irwin1995}


\section{Liquid Democracy}
\label{sec:Liquid_Democracy}

Even though there are many forms of political government, it is democracy that spread around the globe over the last hundred years (see \autoref{fig:democracy-trend}). \textit{“As of the end of 2016, 97 out of 167 countries (58\,\%) [\ldots] were democracies [\ldots]”} \parencite{Desilver2017}. According to the observations in \autoref{fig:democracy-trend} it can be argued that democracy is a successful and thus modern structure, since there is no competing political system showing a similar thriving trend as democracy does. Although there are concerns that democracy is endangered (cf. \cite{FreedomHouse2019}), it is important to see this evolving trend for democracy on a much larger time scale; which is over decades and centuries.

\end{figure}
Nevertheless, it is neither within the scope of this project to asses democratic characteristics, nor other systems of rule. Democracy, however, entails various advantages compared to other political systems. First and foremost---by its literal translation\footnote{\textit{Rule of the people}, from Ancient Greek: \textgreek{Δημοκρατία} (Dēmokratía): democracy, whereby \textgreek{Δῆμος} (Dêmos) means \textit{the people}, and \textgreek{Κράτος} (Krátos) means \textit{power/strength}.}---democracy empowers its citizens to participate in political processes, and therefore to influence the political pathway. For example, one fundamental element is suffrage, that is, the right to vote. Additionally, democracy allows its people to shape the system’s frame. Thus, a wide range of democracy types\footnote{For further reading see the Wikipedia article \textit{Types of democracy}: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_democracy}.} have evolved over time. The two most prominent types are direct and indirect (or representative) democracy. In direct democracy citizens are directly involved in the decision-making of the state. Yet, a direct democracy does not scale for a growing community, sine it is impossible to inform every citizen “\textit{[\textellipsis{}] about all issues as they either do not have the time, the desire or the expertise.}” \parencite{Schiener2015}. On the other hand, representative democracies---where elected officials represent the voters---scale well, yet they fail to serve the citizens’ interests.

In this project we focus on \textit{liquid democracy}, a variant of democracy that is also known as \textit{delegative democracy}.

\todo[inline]{Hier würde ich noch kurz direkte und repräsentative Demokratie andiskutieren. Hierzu fand ich https://medium.com/organizer-sandbox/liquid-democracy-true-democracy-for-the-21st-century-7c66f5e53b6f ganz gut; ist zwar keine gute Quelle für was wissenschaftliches, aber die Punkte fand ich sinnvoll:  Sadly, direct democracies do not scale, mainly because of rational ignorance and disenfranchisement, due to an ever increasing list of issues that require the voters attention as the community grows. It becomes simply impractical for voters to be informed about all issues as they either do not have the time, the desire or the expertise. This in turn leads to low voter turnout and low overall satisfaction of voters in the community. Direct democracies in its purest form are simply not feasible for larger communities. Als Hauptkritikpunkte für repräsentative Demokratie fügen sie den kleinen Kreis der wählbaren, Mangel an accountability und Konzentration von Macht an}

\subsection{Liquid Democracy Terminology}
\label{ssec:Liquid_Democracy}

Liquid Democracy (\tracknshrink{LD}) is a type of democracy lying in between two major democracy forms: direct democracy and indirect (or representative) democracy. This \textit{liquid} intersection allows citizens to either delegate their vote to a proxy (i.e., a representative) or to vote directly for a certain state of affairs (e.g., a proposition).

It is important to point out that the voting form \textit{proxy voting} shares some similarities of liquid democracy. There is, however, a fundamental difference: in liquid democracy a proxy may further delegate his/her voices to another proxy, which is not intended for proxy voting. Therefore, a proxy or representative, in the concept of liquid democracy, can be---mathematically---interpreted as a transitive (recursive) vertex within a directed graph. \citeauthor{Kahng2018} states:

\begin{displayquote}
“In contrast to the classic proxy voting paradigm \parencite{Miller1969}, the key innovation underlying liquid democracy is that proxies [\textellipsis] may delegate their own vote to a proxy, and, in doing so, further delegate all the votes entrusted to them. Put another way [\textellipsis] votes may freely flow through the directed delegation graph until they reach a sink.”\\[1mm]
\hspace*{\fill}\textcite{Kahng2018}
\end{displayquote}
The delegation graph is a fundamental component of liquid democracy. \autoref{fig:Delegation-Cascade} visualizes such a delegation graph/cascade. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics{delegation-cascade.png}
	\caption[Delegate cascade voting]{“A snapshot of a small election in which two separate cascades have formed. Vote flow is depicted by arrows, and volume by numbers. The votes flow together until they pool at the bottom, where they are held by the leading candidates.” \parencite{Allen2008}}
	\label{fig:Delegation-Cascade}
\end{figure}
However, direct voting is neither intended in proxy voting nor in delegation graphs. Therefore---and to fulfill the initial definition of \tracknshrink{LD}---the delegation graph must be extended to permit direct voting, which then allows to further classify the terms: proxy voting, delegation graph and liquid democracy in a true subset relationship: \textit{proxy voting \(\subsetneq\) delegation graph \(\subsetneq\) liquid democracy}. Thus, the concept of liquid democracy acts as a superset for proxy voting and delegation graphs. 

\subsection{Liquid Democracy Mechanics}
\label{ssec:Liquid_Democracy_Mechanics}

Due to its superset position liquid democracy combines characteristics from proxy voting, delegation graphs and direct voting. To visualize this concept in a simplified manner \autoref{fig:Liquid-Democracy-Delegated-Voting} illustrates the main steps of a voting process within a liquid democracy system.

In liquid democracy, and in directed delegation graphs, the vote always flows from a \textit{principal}\todo{explain Proxy with a reference} to a \textit{proxy}, and, initially, each citizen always starts as a  principal holding their own voice, as depicted in the first column in \autoref{fig:Liquid-Democracy-Delegated-Voting}. From there, each individual has two choices: (1) to vote \textit{directly} for a given state of affairs (Option A, B or C) or (2) to \textit{delegate} their voice to a 
proxy. Naturally, and for the sake of completeness, citizens have the right to abstain from voting at all, however, in this work we set the focus on people seeking for participation. Thus, choice (1) entitles citizens to \textit{directly} influence a given state of affairs, as depicted in red. Apparently, voting as a ‘initial principal’ yields to the lowest voting impact of \(1\), which is by definition your own inherent voice. Choice (2) entitles citizens to \textit{delegate} their voice to a proxy, which can be the case when the (initial) principal is doubtful in their decision-making (\textit{uncertainty} is depicted by gray color in \autoref{fig:Liquid-Democracy-Delegated-Voting}).

If, however, an individual receives a single voice or multiple voices they automatically become a proxy. In this position they have the same two choices as the principals had before, that is, to either directly vote or to further delegate their votes. This characteristic demonstrates the recursive nature of a liquid democracy system. In the case of an uncertain proxy (column two, \autoref{fig:Liquid-Democracy-Delegated-Voting}), the proxy might further delegate their voices. Technically, by doing so, the proxy becomes a principal, yet with a higher voting impact, since the voting count gets accumulated along the graph, whereby each node has a natural weight of \(1\).

Ultimately, each edge will hit at some point their last node, which are---in a liquid democracy system---individuals being certain about their decision-making and have an opinion (\textit{certainty} is depicted by colors in \autoref{fig:Liquid-Democracy-Delegated-Voting}). In this step there are no further delegations.

\subsection{Critical Perspective}
\label{ssec:LD-Critical-Perspective}

Allen nach oben und den Abuse hier rein
[Remark Simon: Noch ein vielleicht interessanter Auszug aus Polyas (https://www.polyas.de/blog/en/digital-democracy/liquid-democracy-2) : Critics say that giving ordinary people more power who may not fully understand the ramifications of their vote could be disastrous for the running of a country.

Similarly, people are concerned that the people are easily swayed by targeted campaigning, meaning that laws may be created that may not necessarily be in the good of the wider public, but rather those with the marketing budgets.]

There is a variety of scientific articles and questions that are widely discussed in various online platforms (see REFERENCES). For this report we highlight some of them in regards
we assume that voters can only delegate their votes to better-informed voters \parencite{Allen2008}


Traditionally, in a parliamentarian democracy, the right to initiate and vote on propositions is exclusive for members of the parliament.
However, in a liquid democracy, by definition every participant has the right to vote on propositions, and participate in their constitutive phase.
Consequently, every participant should also have the unrestrained right to create propositions.

\subsection{Digital Liquid Democracy}
\label{ssec:Digital_LD}
While both direct democracy and representative democracy have existed before the digital revolution (and have thus been practiced before the availability of digital tools), digitalization has an enormous effect on liquid democracy. While digitalization is often quoted for optimization, its true potential lies in its disruptiveness, by enabling processes that would not be possible otherwise. These two perspectives on digitalization are caught exemplary by the blog entry of \href{https://www.aoe.com/en/blog/digital-politics-how-digitalization-will-change-the-political-process.html}{Alain Veuve}, which focuses on process efficiency and mentions that liquid democracy and digitalization can raise the number of participants in political process, but also remarks on the dedogmafication of politics. This dedogmafication implies that representative democracy is becoming an anacronism, and that digitalization has the disruptive potential to reform (or better said revolve) this form of governance towards liquid democracy. 
\href{https://www.polyas.de/blog/en/digital-democracy/liquid-democracy-2}{Jaqueline Bargmann} views it the other way around, as digitalization being the requirement for implementing the complex voting procedures that liquid democracy needs to based upon. These would be impossible to perform offline. 
The popularity of online petitions coincide with the observation of political apathy, which shows the need for more participatory opportunities in the political sphere. In a representative democracy, participation is limited to petitions (which rarely have any real effect), professional politicians (which is not a real option for most citizens) or activities out of the direct sphere of politics (in the form of social activism). This lack of participatory opportunities, coined the problem of liquidity (as the lack of availability of resources to bring about political change) by the \href{https://www.democracy.earth/}{democracy.earth} project, is ever more clear through the decline of freedom within democracies and political apathy of voters is seen as a problem of liquidity of these systems (\href{https://govfresh.com/2019/01/liquid-democracy-blockchains-and-governance-in-the-post-nation-state-era/}{id.}). While formally democracy are on the win (as shown in \ref{fig:democracy-trend}), the rise of autocratic tendencies, as seen for example in the \href{https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2019/democracy-in-retreat}{Freedom In the World report}, is not unlikely to stem from a crisis of political liquidity \todo[inline]{Vielleicht mal in den Bericht reinschauen}.

With the shift from passive consumers to active participants through the Web 2.0, as isolated within social bubbles it may be, digitalization has a participatory drive for societal processes. Coupled with the availability of knowledge (and its universality of access), it supports ease of discourse. This discourse can lead to anything from political impulses to avalanches (as is often quoted with the role of technology and digitalization for the Arab Spring). The knowledge stemming from these processes and 'crowd intelligence' is too precious not to be used for systems that give sovereignty to the governed. Even more so, as \href{https://newint.org/features/2015/01/01/democracy-digital-era-keynote}{Birgitta Jónsdóttir warns},  wisdom needs to be extracted from this knowledge.
The increasing interconnectivity through technology, processes and interaction has the potential to make the individual more vulnerable, but allows for organization, informedness and control. This however requires participatory political structures and processes, which are just the fundamentals that liquid democracy addresses.


\section[An Integrative Perspective for CS in LD]{An Integrative Perspective for Citizen Science in Liquid Democracy}
\label{sec:Integration_CSLD}
The discussion above shows that liquid democracy, in particular in a digitalized age, has the potential to be a powerful vehicle for the empowerment of citizens as political subjects. Where citizen science strives for the scientific and educational empowerment of citizens, liquid democracy aims at their political empowerment. The discussion furthermore implies that the quality of the political discourse depends on a sound factual basis of digital liquid democracy, and the capability of discourse, as well as the informedness of political subjects. This is particularly the case for a society challenged and blessed with interconnectivity. It requires the shift of power structures from representational politics that is solely confined to professional politicians and rigid parties to 'the (informed) masses'; similarly, in the current system, science is strongly confined to professional scientists and institutions instead of the broad masses. Both, the concept of citizen science and liquid democracy thus address a shift of power from exclusive spheres within the society to empowerment of citizens. That does not mean that either program wants to do away with the professional practitioner. On the contrary, both require highly competent, capable and trained professionals that, in addition to their own specialty, have profound transdisciplinary skills that give them the responsibility for a professional perspective on the issues at hand.

\todo[inline]{Im folgenden klarer machen inwiefern Liquid Democracy zu Citizen Science beitragen kann: Datenbasis (rausstellen, dass Datne(produktion) nicht die Partizipation von citizens ist, sondern diese die Daten des Gegenstandes nehmen und analysieren), Labor um Hypothesen zu konstruieren und testen, (braucht Struktur für wiss. Arbeiten fúr hohe Stufe von Hackley; wichtig versch. Schritte wiss. Prozess abzugehen und zu fragen wie citizens darin involviert sind.). ANlernen von Citizens wichtig: Bereitstellen von WErkzeugen, workshops, Schulungen etc. }
Moreover, a healthy political discourse needs a sound factual and scientific basis; in particular one that can be understood by political subjects. By opening up the analysis of political issues and processes to citizen scientists, the system of non-partisan information stemming from political and social scientists, journalists, NGOs and political commentators and analysts can be put on a fifth column: empowered political subjects themselves. Furthermore, by including political subjects in the process of deriving knowledge, the educative element of citizen science is strengthened, so that they can make more informed decisions. This can also be expected to alleviate political apathy of the citizens involved in these projects, although it is likely that most citizens involved in citizen science projects on political matters are not predisposed to the political apathy anyways; getting their voices heard might however be the key for some to change that apathy to activism. In the lingo of Birgitta Jónsdóttir, this enables political subjects to extract wisdom from this knowledge.

\todo[inline]{Herausstellen, dass es nicht nur politisches, sondern auch wiss. involvement von Citizens ist. ZU wichtig um es nur zu nennen, sondern sollte auch diskutiert werden.}
As discussed above, citizen science is often accused of amateurism (which is to a large extend the whole point of citizen science), which can be considered a valid point of critique to some extend, especially when the projects are poorly set up. For the political discourse however, the matter is somewhat different. Political discourse is (or should be) often based in (established) science; however, methods within an active political discourse are much less strict than those used in science, and the role of rhethorics and agenda-setting are more important than the epistomological state of its statements. The political discourse is less exclusive than scientific discourses, and political skill and the formation of policies can be seen as influencing the dynamics of opinions in groups.

\todo[inline]{Verteidigen warum wir uns im folgenden so stark auf LD beziehen/konzipieren, und wenig auf CS }
One large problematic matter however for bringing together citizen science and liquid democracy remains, namely the issue of privacy and open data, discussed in the following.


\subsection{Data Accessibility and Anonymity}
\label{ssec:Integration_AccessibilityAnonymity}
Arguably the most challenging aspect of a CS-based LD platform, is the tension between data accessibility and anonymity. As stressed \todo{actually stress it!} in \ref{ssec:LD-Critical-Perspective}, vote anonymity is a crucial aspect of democratic voting systems. On the other hand, a lack of transparency and data accessibility \todo[inline]{reduces the Citizen Scientist} to a data provider, devoiding a system of its participatory nature and transforming it into a mere crowd-sourcing platform (from a CS perspective). In order to allowing Citizens to pose (and investigate) research questions based on real-world data within their context of interest and expertise, as well as for delegators to evaluate whether their values are represented appropriately by delegants, data accessibility / transparency (at least to some degree) is imperative.

Although at first glance transparency and anonymity might seems like a null-sum-game where increased data accessibility constitute a violation of a users privacy, a number of strategies do exists that tackle these problems.

\subsubsection{Decoupling User Accounts from Personal Identity}

The most obvious strategy might be to decouple the user account from the personal identity of a user. When done consecuently, with proper protection of data (and the personal identity of the user is used solely to validate the vote connected to the account, or even just the existence of the account), all data of the user can be transparent by everyone, and no restrictions on the data accessiblity needs to be enforced. While this is the optimal solution from the perspective of the Citizen Scientist, and the delegator that can (in theory) perfectly evaluate whether her political power was used as intended, this approach is not without danger.

First, and most obviously, this approach is very problematic when a breach of the separation of the user and personal identity of the user occurs. Perfect safety does not exist, and many cases where sensitive (and this would be highly sensitive) information was exposed do exist (citation needed). More subtly however, with perfect accessibility of user data, with more and more detailed data, increasingly detailed profiles can be constructed, which are more and more likely to be bound to a person by tying their democratic persona to their personal identity (citation needed). While this might be somewhat harder for 'non-public' persons, for people active in the public sphere by their personal identities (e.g. politicians), this link would be easy to establish. One thoughtless given detail might be enough to link the entirety of the user persona to the human behind their account, making transparent in its entirety all activity and views every uttered on the platform. 
Most problematic about this issue from a participatory democratic perspective is the mechanics that more involvement leads to a higher probability of (someone sufficiently clever) the user persona being linked to the person behind this, thus rather discouraging than encouraging engagement in the participatory processes.

\subsubsection{Aggregating User Data}

Another, rather conservative solution for this issue would be to anonymize the user data by aggregating voting behaviour by demographic aspects of users. A scientist would thus get access to the distribution of voting patterns, vote delegation patterns or involvement in issues by certain demographics. Though preserving the anonymity and privacy integrity of the person behind a user, it has two shortcomings. First, this employs a conservative empiric perspective (since science by demography is out and attitude and behaviour, as well as cognitive patterns are en vogue (citation needed)). Second, this enables the interested scientist only to ask one type of question. The form of the research question is thus already pre-determined by the designers of the platform, and the demographic categories users provide. While this doesn't hinder Citizen Scientists to design and perform studies on the data, this doesn't realize the high participatory level of involvement in the research process that we would strive for in this project.

An aspect not addressed by this perspective is how much information a delegator would receive about the delegant (and the delegants it re-delegates the vote to). Since the usage of the single vote of the delegant is of interest, an aggregated perspective does not answer how well he could ensure his values are respected. With absolute transparency of the behaviour of the delegant to the delegator, a malign and smart (group of) delegators could derive information that would validate this paradigm.

\subsubsection{Deflecting Responsibility}

An easy, yet cowardish, third option for dealing with this problem would be to shift the responsibility for this from the platform's designers or operators to the users. Users could decide how much information they want to make available to other users / scientists and their delegators. While this has the chance to solve the problem and pay users the respect of being mature enough to decide this, this might lead to transparency pressure that every user that wants to accumulate political power needs to justify himself. Maybe deciding to pay this price is what can be expected from a politician, but this decision should not be engrained in the architecture of the platform. How easy such a setup would be for a scientist who has to deal with (potentially a lot of) partial information needs to be evaluated.

\subsubsection{Selective Aggregation}

A further, much more involved option would be to 'hide' unaggregated information for inquiring scientists, and to allow only information of a certain level of aggregation. Though similar to the second option posed above, this is quite a different approach to the problem at hand, since this approach explicitly opposes restricting research questions to a set / style of pre-formed research questions. The idea behind this approach is to allow all \textit{kind} of data inquiries, as long as certain criteria are met. These criteria are thought to ensure the anonymity of the user identity against inquiring entities, and would be the main design issue of this concept. As an example, criteria could be quantitative, only allowing access to data with a given amount of entities. This could be realized e.g. through a data query language with a filter instance, only allowing responses on data instances of a given size (in the style of 'how many people that voted like this in elections of this context voted like that / delegated votes' with a negative response when there are only a handful of instances and a valid answer when there are a substantial number of instances). Establishing these criteria would probably result in a lot of (hard) work, but might well be worth it. Whether research would be possible with the partial answers this approach generates, is a different question altogether. 
This approach further doesn't give an answer to transparency of vote delegation for individual political subjects raised above.

\section{Criteria for a CS based LD Platform}
\label{sec:Criteria}
Based on the discussion above, the following criteria for a citizen science based liquid democracy platform are discussed in the following.

In an anonymized large-scale digital liquid democracy, this right could be abused by malicious users to mass-create so called spam propositions in order to bury other propositions and prevent users from voting on them.
We aim to reduce this threat through the following measures: (1) phased proposition life cycles, (2) adaptive sorting algorithms based on bayesian filtering and (3) moderation.
