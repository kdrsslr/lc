    % Unfortunately we cant use the convenient \path (fromnode) -- (tonode) 
    % syntax here. This is because TikZ draws the path from the node centers
    % and clip the path at the node boundaries. We want horizontal lines, but
    % the sensor and naveq blocks aren't aligned horizontally. Instead we use
    % the line intersection syntax |- to calculate the correct coordinate
    \path [draw, ->] (c1) -- node [above] {}
        (serviceLayer.west |- c1) ;
    % We could simply have written (gyros) .. (naveq.140). However, it's
    % best to avoid hard coding coordinates
    \path [draw, ->] (c2) -- node [above] {}
        (serviceLayer.west |- c2);
    \path [draw, ->] (cn) -- node [above] {}
        (serviceLayer.west |- cn);
    \node (clientLayerLabel) [below=1em of cn,align=center] {Client layer \\ (users)};
    
    % Now it's time to draw the colored IMU and INS rectangles.
    % To draw them behind the blocks we use pgf layers. This way we  
    % can use the above block coordinates to place the backgrounds   
    \begin{pgfonlayer}{background}
        % Compute a few helper coordinates
        \path (c1.west |- serviceLayer.north)+(-0.7,0.5) node (a) {};
        \path (c1.north west)+(-0.3,0.3) node (a) {};
        \path (clientLayerLabel.south -| c1.east)+(+0.4,-0.4) node (b) {};
        \path[fill=white!10,rounded corners, draw=black!50, dashed]
            (a) rectangle (b);
